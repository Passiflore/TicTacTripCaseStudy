# City Location Explorer - Technical Test 🌍📍
Welcome to my project, the technical test project for Tictactrip that leverages multiple city location APIs and implements a design inspired by the SNCF Connect platform. Built with React and ViteJS, my goal was to provide a seamless and intuitive searchBar for exploring cities around the world.

## Overview 📝
This project has been developed as a part of a technical test for Tictactrip, showcasing my ability to deliver a functional and visually appealing project within a limited timeframe (2 sleepless nights! 😴🦉). I chose ViteJS for its fast development and production performance and used fetch() for making API calls. With a touch of humor 😄 and a professional approach, this README aims to provide you with all the necessary information to understand and evaluate the project.

## Technical Choices 💻
ViteJS: Lightning-fast development and production performance ⚡
React: Popular and flexible front-end library for building user interfaces ⚛️
fetch(): Fetch API for straightforward and easy-to-use HTTP requests 🌐

## Design 🎨
The design of this project is heavily inspired by the SNCF Connect platform, providing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. Great design is crucial for an enjoyable user experience, and I've put in the extra effort to make this project as engaging as possible. Your feedback on the design is highly appreciated! 🙌

## Remarks & Feedback ✍️
As a project developed within a limited time, I'm aware that this project might not be perfect. However, I believe in continuous improvement like using **React Query**, your feedbacks, issues, or suggestions. I'll do my best to address them as quickly as possible, but please bear in mind that I may be recovering from those sleepless nights (just kidding, your feedback is important! 😊).

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with City Location Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine 📁
2. Install the dependencies with npm install 📦
3. Run the project with `npm run dev` and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` 🌐

Thank you for taking the time to review this technical test project! I hope you find the implementation, design, and overall experience enjoyable and up to your expectations.
